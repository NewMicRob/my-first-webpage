# my-first-webpage

During this assignment I learned the fundamentals and basic skills needed to implement and deploy a GitHub hosted website that links 2 pages together. Throughout this assignment, I also looked ahead into CSS styling, so I tweaked some of the settings to get more of a grasp on the weeks to come. 

Some of the things I learned was how to create and center a table, create and center an incremental numbered list using an ordered list. I also learned how to add and modify an image size, and how to change the background colour of the table list, body of the website, and the colour of the table.
